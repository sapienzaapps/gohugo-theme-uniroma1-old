# Hugo theme for Sapienza website (old style)

This theme is a porting of the old template for Sapienza University websites.

![preview](example.png "Preview website")

All "folders" below the header are taken from the first level of `main` menu. All subtrees are drawn in the left menu in the corresponding "folder".

In the front-matter you can add a `pagemenu` key with an array of items to be drawn in the left part of the page.
